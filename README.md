This App was developed during a POC by mashing up an Alpha version of the app and mixing it with work that Tom Smit completed.

This App only requires that all of the data is in index=akamai.  The "Akamai Dashboards" and "Dashboards" sections will contain all of the functioning dashboards.

Feel free to contact jim@splunk.com (James Donn) with any questions.
